== Add the first validation ==
We are now able to register a user with a certain username and age. However, we don't want our users to be too young; let's say they must be *at least 21* to register on our application. 

==== Apply the simplest validation ====
Let's modify the User bean to apply this validation. We simply add an annotation from the Hibernate Validator framework to the age field:
{{{
@Column
@Min(value = 21)
private Integer age;
}}}
Redeploy the app and try to register a user setting an age lower than 21: hibernate validator does its work and stops us, giving an error:
