In this tutorial we'll follow the case of a user registration form, and we'll apply different validations to this form to make sure the user data can't be wrong!

==The "Hello World" of DHEV==
First we need setup a Seam project with a few components in there. You can either build it from scratch and add what we'll discuss in a few lines, or download this [http://code.google.com/p/dhev/downloads/detail?name=DHEV-Tutorial.rar&can=2&q= archive] which contains an eclipse project ready to be imported. The project contains these main things:
  * User bean: this is the model representing the User. It's a usual pojo decorated with JPA annotations for the persistence, and of course a @Name since we'll use it as a Seam component. For now our user has only a couple of fields, username and age:
   {{{
//com.dhev.model.User.java

   }}}

==Limits==
TODO talk about include limit feature (we don't want the max age included anymore); future plan to make this changeable at runtime

==Messages==
TODO talk about how to set up error messages (messages_en.properties), how to change them, etc.

==Exceptions==
TODO talk about what are the most common error cases and how users could manage them
