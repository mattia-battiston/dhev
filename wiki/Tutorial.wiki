= DHEV Tutorial =

In this tutorial we'll follow the case of a user registration form, and we'll apply different validations to this form to make sure the user data can't be wrong!

We assume you have a basic understanding of how Seam works, anyway we'll try to keep things clear and simple.

  * [TutorialSetup Setup the project]: setup a new Seam project, the "users registration", which we'll use to demonstrate DHEV 
  * [TutorialFirstValidation Add our first validation]: add the first validation to the user
  * [TutorialLimitMessage Limits and messages]: play with limits of the validations and error messages
  * [TutorialException Evaluation exceptions]: understand how to manage exceptions from DHEV
