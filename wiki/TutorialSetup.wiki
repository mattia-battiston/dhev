== Setup the project ==

First we need to setup a Seam project with a few components in there. You can either build it from scratch and add what we'll discuss in a few lines, or download this [http://code.google.com/p/dhev/downloads/detail?name=DHEV-Tutorial.rar&can=2&q= archive] which contains an eclipse project ready to be imported. The project contains these main things:
  * User bean: this is the model representing the User. It's a usual pojo decorated with JPA annotations for the persistence, and of course a @Name since we'll use it as a Seam component. For now our user has only a couple of fields, username and age:
   {{{
//com.dhev.model.User.java
