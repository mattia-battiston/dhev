- How to install DHEV in your project:
Simply include /dhev-VERSION.jar in your project. 

- How to run the example:
DHEV-Example is a JBoss Seam project which demonstrates the use of DHEV. In order to
run it, copy /sample/dist/dhev-example.ear and /sample/resources/dhev-ds.xml to your 
JBoss instance and start it.
Alternatively, if you prefer to rebuild the sample project:
   * make sure properties in file build.properties are correct (point to your own jboss instance) 
   * launch the deploy task from the build.xml that is included in the sample: "ant deploy". This
     will recompile the project and deploy it
